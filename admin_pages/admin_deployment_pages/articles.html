                <td>What is machine learning? Machine learning is the idea that there are generic algorithms that can
                    tell you something interesting about a set of data without you having to write any custom code
                    specific to the problem. Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm and it
                    builds its own logic based on the data. For example, one kind of algorithm is a classification
                    algorithm. It can put data into different groups. The same classification algorithm used to
                    recognize handwritten numbers could also be used to classify emails into spam and not-spam without
                    changing a line of code. It’s the same algorithm but it’s fed different training data so it comes
                    up with different classification logic. This machine learning algorithm is a black box that can be
                    re-used for lots of different classification problems. “Machine learning” is an umbrella term
                    covering lots of these kinds of generic algorithms. Two kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms You
                    can think of machine learning algorithms as falling into one of two main categories — supervised
                    learning and unsupervised learning. The difference is simple, but really important. Supervised
                    Learning Let’s say you are a real estate agent. Your business is growing, so you hire a bunch of
                    new trainee agents to help you out. But there’s a problem — you can glance at a house and have a
                    pretty good idea of what a house is worth, but your trainees don’t have your experience so they
                    don’t know how to price their houses. To help your trainees (and maybe free yourself up for a
                    vacation), you decide to write a little app that can estimate the value of a house in your area
                    based on it’s size, neighborhood, etc, and what similar houses have sold for. So you write down
                    every time someone sells a house in your city for 3 months. For each house, you write down a bunch
                    of details — number of bedrooms, size in square feet, neighborhood, etc. But most importantly, you
                    write down the final sale price: This is our “training data.” Using that training data, we want to
                    create a program that can estimate how much any other house in your area is worth: We want to use
                    the training data to predict the prices of other houses. This is called supervised learning. You
                    knew how much each house sold for, so in other words, you knew the answer to the problem and could
                    work backwards from there to figure out the logic. To build your app, you feed your training data
                    about each house into your machine learning algorithm. The algorithm is trying to figure out what
                    kind of math needs to be done to make the numbers work out. This kind of like having the answer key
                    to a math test with all the arithmetic symbols erased: Oh no! A devious student erased the
                    arithmetic symbols from the teacher’s answer key! From this, can you figure out what kind of math
                    problems were on the test? You know you are supposed to “do something” with the numbers on the left
                    to get each answer on the right. In supervised learning, you are letting the computer work out that
                    relationship for you. And once you know what math was required to solve this specific set of
                    problems, you could answer to any other problem of the same type! </td>
