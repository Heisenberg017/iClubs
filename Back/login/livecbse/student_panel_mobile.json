Take a look at your T-shirt, or the computer screen you are looking into right now, or the curtains in your room and whole entire room itself. These are all built through design.\r\nAs our world becomes increasingly digital and online, creating visual designs for digital platforms has become a necessity. So, let’s get introduced to Digital Design. \r\nDuring the entire month of December, our iClub will help you get introduced to Digital Design. We have compiled a lot of resources and tools for you to get a basic understanding of design.\r\nIn the coming months, we will dive a little deeper into digital design and learn a little more about design softwares, uses of Colours and Symbols and actually experiment making a few designs ourselves\r\nSo, without further ado, lets start your journey with Digital Design!",
