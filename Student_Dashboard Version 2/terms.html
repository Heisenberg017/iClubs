        the products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that

      </p>
      <h1 class="term-topic">1. Our Services</h1>
      <p class="terms-desc_topic">
        Iclubs is a platform where educationists and experts can create original
        content or curate the same from other sources for the benefit of the
        students who are a part of iclubs. The curated content should follow the
        guidelines for non copyright infringement. We wish to provide meaningful
        opportunities for kids to explore, experience and express themselves in
        field/s of their choice, liking or competence. <br /><br />To help
        advance this mission, we provide the products and curation services
        described below to you: <br /><br />
        Provide a personalised experience for the school & its students:<br /><br />
        The experience on iClubs will spread from the Articles, Videos, Posts,
        Events, and other content that you see in Explore/Experience/Express on
        our platform respective to the iclub and iclub category. We use the data
        we have – for example, about the articles and videos how the student
        browses, the choices and settings from student & club coordinator, and
        what you share and do on and off our services – to enhance user
        experience.<br /><br />
        Content on iclubs for students: There are 3 types of contents on iclubs
      </p>
      <ul class="terms_list">
        <li>1. Content curated/created by iclubs.</li>
        <li>
          2. Content curated and created by assigned members of the clubs of the
          respective schools.
        </li>
        <li>3. Content created by the students.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="terms-desc_topic">
        1. We completely understand different societies and regions may have
        different set of values for their children. We believe The schools are
        the best judges for understanding the appropriateness of the content.
        Hence, school has complete authority to evaluate and then approve the
        content before it appears on iclub platform for students. We will always
        make best efforts to suggest contents we feel are well covered by
        copyright and IPR and will be safe for schools to share. In case the
        school authorities come across such content please inform us and we
        would research and remove the content
      </p>
      <p class="terms-desc_topic">
        2. The iclubs platform can also be used by the student to create and
        manage their own clubs for students. There could be content sharing from
        other websites it is the duty of the schools/content providers to
        understand and before approving the content we recommend that schools to
        understand whether the content is sharable or not. (For e.g. it is
        understood that youtube content which has been labelled as shareable by
        the uploader on youtube can be used by school to share with their
        students). There may be content suggestions by iclubs content team for
        particular iclubs.<br /><br />
        To help schools make an informed judgement towards the appropriateness
        of content we help them wrt guidelines around copyright and other laws
        applicable to the region. The schools can approach us for further
        clarifications from time to time.
      </p>
      <p class="terms-desc_topic">
        3. Some assignments and projects might require students to upload their
        projects in digital format on the website. The content created by
        students is solely the property of the students. We may review the
        content from time to time to check the appropriateness of the content.
        We may also remove the content not following under the guidelines of
        required project. This is expected to be done from school side. We may
        review the project to help the student/s to connect to field experts and
        enthusiasts. The project work can also be analyzed to improve the
        quality of our communication wrt to achieving desired outputs.

      <h1 class="term-topic">Building Community</h1>
      <p class="terms-desc_topic">
        Stronger ties make better communities, and we believe that our services

        you find and connect with people, experts from different fields,
        educationalists, groups, businesses, organisations and others that
        matter to school and students for driving the iClubs activities. We use
        the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others – for
        example, recommended workshops, webinars, courses for students; groups
        to join, events to attend, Pages to follow, videos to watch, articles
        and blogs to read, quizzes that can be taken by students.
        <br /><br />Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what
        matters to you: There are many ways to express student’s or teacher’s
        talent on iClubs and to communicate with other students, parents and
        whole school – for example, sharing undertaken projects and assignments,
        photos, videos and articles on iClubs, creating events or groups, or
        adding or downloading content to your profile. We have also developed,
        and continue to explore, new ways for students to use technology, to
        create and share more expressive and engaging content on iClubs.
        <br /><br />Help you discover content, products and services that may
        interest you: We showcase and help you discover content, products and

                          We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better
                          for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to
                          accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you
                          before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they
                          go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to
                          use our Products.
                          We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms
                          and no longer want to be a part of the iClubs, you can delete your account at any time.

                            account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your account or
                            disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for
                            us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you
                            about your account the next time you try to access it. You can learn more about what you can do if
                            your account has been disabled, by writing to us</p>

                              they will always be safe, secure or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or

                                a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws

                                If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of

                                Testune Products ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country
                                that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved
                                exclusively in the Mumbai jurisdiction US District Court for the Northern District of California or a
                                state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of
                                these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California
                                will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions</p>
