							<h1 class="terms-head_sub">
							  Welcome to iClubs - by Testune Technologies Pvt Ltd.
							</h1>
							<p class="terms-desc">
							  These terms govern your use of Testune Technology Pvt Ltd. - iClubs and
							  the products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that
							  we offer (the iClubs.in or Products), except where we expressly state
							  that separate Terms (and not these) apply.
							</p>
							<h1 class="term-topic">1. Our Services</h1>
							<p class="terms-desc_topic">
							  Iclubs is a platform where educationists and experts can create original
							  content or curate the same from other sources for the benefit of the
							  students who are a part of iclubs. The curated content should follow the
							  guidelines for non copyright infringement. We wish to provide meaningful
							  opportunities for kids to explore, experience and express themselves in
							  field/s of their choice, liking or competence. <br /><br />To help
							  advance this mission, we provide the products and curation services
							  described below to you: <br /><br />
							  Provide a personalised experience for the school & its students:<br /><br />
							  The experience on iClubs will spread from the Articles, Videos, Posts,
							  Events, and other content that you see in Explore/Experience/Express on
							  our platform respective to the iclub and iclub category. We use the data
							  we have - for example, about the articles and videos how the student
							  browses, the choices and settings from student & club coordinator, and
							  what you share and do on and off our services - to enhance user
							  experience.<br /><br />
							  Content on iclubs for students: There are 3 types of contents on iclubs
							</p>
							<ul class="terms_list">
							  <li>1. Content curated/created by iclubs.</li>
							  <li>
								2. Content curated and created by assigned members of the clubs of the
								respective schools.
							  </li>
							  <li>3. Content created by the students.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="terms-desc_topic">
							  1. We completely understand different societies and regions may have
							  different set of values for their children. We believe The schools are
							  the best judges for understanding the appropriateness of the content.
							  Hence, school has complete authority to evaluate and then approve the
							  content before it appears on iclub platform for students. We will always
							  make best efforts to suggest contents we feel are well covered by
							  copyright and IPR and will be safe for schools to share. In case the
							  school authorities come across such content please inform us and we
							  would research and remove the content
							</p>
							<p class="terms-desc_topic">
							  2. The iclubs platform can also be used by the student to create and
							  manage their own clubs for students. There could be content sharing from
							  other websites it is the duty of the schools/content providers to
							  understand and before approving the content we recommend that schools to
							  understand whether the content is sharable or not. (For e.g. it is
							  understood that youtube content which has been labelled as shareable by
							  the uploader on youtube can be used by school to share with their
							  students). There may be content suggestions by iclubs content team for
							  particular iclubs.<br /><br />
							  To help schools make an informed judgement towards the appropriateness
							  of content we help them wrt guidelines around copyright and other laws
							  applicable to the region. The schools can approach us for further
							  clarifications from time to time.
							</p>
							<p class="terms-desc_topic">
							  3. Some assignments and projects might require students to upload their
							  projects in digital format on the website. The content created by
							  students is solely the property of the students. We may review the
							  content from time to time to check the appropriateness of the content.
							  We may also remove the content not following under the guidelines of
							  required project. This is expected to be done from school side. We may
							  review the project to help the student/s to connect to field experts and
							  enthusiasts. The project work can also be analyzed to improve the
							  quality of our communication wrt to achieving desired outputs.
							</p>
							<h1 class="term-topic">Building Community</h1>
							<p class="terms-desc_topic">
							  Stronger ties make better communities, and we believe that our services
							  are most useful when students/teachers/schools are connected to peer
							  groups and organisations that they care about. Our research team helps
							  you find and connect with people, experts from different fields,
							  educationalists, groups, businesses, organisations and others that
							  matter to school and students for driving the iClubs activities. We use
							  the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others - for
							  example, recommended workshops, webinars, courses for students; groups
							  to join, events to attend, Pages to follow, videos to watch, articles
							  and blogs to read, quizzes that can be taken by students.
							  <br /><br />Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what
							  matters to you: There are many ways to express student's or teacher's
							  talent on iClubs and to communicate with other students, parents and
							  whole school - for example, sharing undertaken projects and assignments,
							  photos, videos and articles on iClubs, creating events or groups, or
							  adding or downloading content to your profile. We have also developed,
							  and continue to explore, new ways for students to use technology, to
